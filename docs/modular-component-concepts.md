# Modular Component Concepts for Untitled Sampler Machine

This document outlines exploratory UI components tailored for the Untitled Sampler Machine. Each concept is designed to reduce clutter, introduce innovative interaction patterns, and showcase playful effect or pad modes with memorable names.

## Space-Saving, Decluttered Modules

### 1. Foldaway Chain Rack
- **Form factor:** A horizontal rack that collapses each effect into an icon-only chip; expanding a chip reveals in-line controls without obscuring the sequencer.
- **Space saving:** Only the active module expands, while inactive ones stay minimized, keeping the screen footprint minimal.
- **Interaction highlights:** Drag chips to reorder; double-tap toggles bypass.

### 2. Corner Carousel Mixer
- **Form factor:** A radial mixer tucked into a corner of the interface with concentric rings for volume, pan, and send levels.
- **Space saving:** Collapses to a single knob when inactive; expands on hover or focus, avoiding persistent mixer strips.
- **Interaction highlights:** Swipe gestures around the ring adjust levels; haptic-like visual ripples indicate value changes.

### 3. Stackable Scene Cards
- **Form factor:** Deck of cards representing scene presets. Only the top card is expanded; others peek out underneath.
- **Space saving:** Tap to bring a card to the top, maintaining just one detailed view at a time.
- **Interaction highlights:** Flick gestures shuffle scenes; cards can be pinned to keep critical setups accessible.

## Innovative UI Controls, Effects, and Visual Treatments

### 1. Ribbon Ripple Controller
- **Concept:** A fluid ribbon control that responds to multi-touch drags, bending pitch and filter parameters simultaneously.
- **Innovation:** Visual ripples propagate along the ribbon to show modulation depth; color shifts indicate parameter locking.

### 2. Ghost Grid Sequencer
- **Concept:** Overlay ghosted future steps with animated transparency, previewing automation envelopes before they trigger.
- **Innovation:** Hovering a ghost cell reveals predictive audio levels; users can "paint" upcoming variations without committing until playback reaches the cell.

### 3. Prism Delay Dome
- **Concept:** 3D dome visualization where delay taps appear as orbiting prisms reflecting the audio spectrum.
- **Innovation:** Users drag prisms closer or farther from the center to change feedback and modulation; color prism facets show frequency emphasis.

## Novel Effect and Pad Modes with Gimmicky Names

### Loop Types
- **Two-Step Tango:** Alternates between two slices with swing-laden micro-slips, ideal for syncopated grooves.
- **Round-Robin Rendezvous:** Cycles through every nth slice with subtle probability offsets to keep loops evolving.
- **Caf√© Churn:** Adds a gentle vinyl swirl with randomized latte-art filter sweeps on each pass.

### Pad Types
- **Sqooshy Splish Splash:** Compresses attack with liquid-style reverb tails; velocity splashes modulate wetness.
- **Bright Beaver:** Hyper-articulate transient enhancer with shimmer harmonics for crisp plucks.
- **Echoing Padded Cell:** Dual-layered ambient pad with binaural reflections and timed diffusion pulses.

### Hybrid Effect Chains
- **Neon Drizzle Drifter:** Combines chorus shimmer, pitch drizzle, and drifting LFO autopan for lush ambient washes.
- **Gritty Velvet Conveyor:** Pairs saturation velvetizer with conveyor-style rhythmic gating for gritty yet smooth grooves.
- **Polaroid Time Capsule:** Tape emulation plus time-stretch smear that snapshots a bar, then gradually releases aged copies back into the mix.

These concepts are intended as starting points for ideation and prototyping within the Untitled Sampler Machine roadmap.
